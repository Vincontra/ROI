2. Generate an App Password
3. Use the App Password in `EMAIL_PASS`

### 4. Start the Application
```bash
# Development mode with auto-restart
npm run dev

# Or production mode
npm start
```

### 5. Access the Dashboard
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 📊 How to Use

### 1. Input Project Data
Fill out the form with your Lean Six Sigma project details:
- **Project Name**: Descriptive name for your project
- **Investment Cost**: Total cost of implementing the LSS project
- **Baseline Defects**: Current number of defects in the system
- **Defect Reduction (%)**: Expected percentage reduction in defects
- **Rework Cost per Defect**: Cost to fix each defect
- **Cycle Time Reduction (%)**: Expected reduction in cycle time
- **Productivity Increase (%)**: Expected increase in productivity

### 2. Calculate ROI
Click "Calculate ROI" to:
- Compute total savings from defect reduction, productivity gains, and time savings
- Calculate net benefit and ROI percentage
- Display results with color-coded status indicators

### 3. View Analytics
Interactive charts show:
- **Before vs After Metrics**: Bar chart comparing baseline vs improved metrics
- **Savings Contribution**: Pie chart breaking down different savings components

### 4. Generate Reports
- **PDF Report**: Click "Generate PDF Report" to download a comprehensive report
- **Email Report**: Enter email address and click "Send Email" to receive the report

### 5. Track History
View the last 10 ROI calculations in the history table, including:
- Project name, ROI percentage, investment, net benefit, and date

## 🧮 ROI Calculation Formula

The application uses the following formula to calculate ROI:

```
Defect Savings = Baseline Defects × (Defect Reduction % / 100) × Rework Cost per Defect
Productivity Gains = Investment × (Productivity Increase % / 100)
Time Savings = Investment × (Cycle Time Reduction % / 100)

Total Savings = Defect Savings + Productivity Gains + Time Savings
Net Benefit = Total Savings - Investment
ROI = (Net Benefit / Investment) × 100
```
